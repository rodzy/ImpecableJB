# ImpecableJB
An ASP.Net C# e-comerce based app using MVC entity framework and Bootstrap.<br/>
The application is associated with an SQL database, related to the sale of cleaning products and
services in which you need to make purchases or orders. ðŸ›’ <br/>
*P.S: This project was part of one my ASP.NET courses in college*

## Modules

This modules are the basic tasks, but in reality the Models & Controller layer in the project are way more complex to handle all the relations between them.<br/>
*P.S: It's safe to mention that the code was written in Spanish as a requirement for my course*
